Sunny, Warm, just a perfect setting for a morning

Scarlet: “About time you woke up!”
Axel: “Glad to see that you’re alive.” 
Axel: “We have to meet up with Countess Serena in an hour in the Royal Fields.”
Jal: “Do you know what for?”
Axel: “Not exactly. All she said was that it was urgent.”
Scarlet: “..So eat up and let’s book it Jal. Always waiting for you..”
Jal: “Well then. Somebody’s salty.”
Scarlet: “Well, maybe if we didn’t have to wait for you, everything would run smoother!”
